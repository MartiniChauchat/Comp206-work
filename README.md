### Multi-process sorting
This is a demo for sort a long string array in multi-process that implement by 
semaphore-based synchronization, you can find the outputs in **/outputs** , use 
```
make 
```
to unwrap the program 
use 
```
make test_single_short
make test_single_long
```
to test sorting in single-process
and use 
```
make test_multi_short
make test_multi_long
```
to test sorting in multi-process
